# send-email-ses
This is a demo to send email with [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) API V2 and [AWS JDK V2](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/sesv2/package-summary.html).

# Compilation
## Prerequisites
To compile send-email-ses you will ned:
- JDK ver 11.0+. [Amazon Coretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/) distribution is recommended.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
## How to compile it
To compile send-email-ses you will need to execute next maven command:

<code>mvn verify</code></br>

Wait a minute...

Why did not just execute

<code>mvn clean package</code>?

See: https://andresalmiray.com/maven-verify-or-clean-install/ from [@aalmiray](https://twitter.com/aalmiray).

Once compilates successfully you can use the fat jar (a jar file with all dependencies included) like a command line tool to test by sending emails using  [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/).

The fat jar will be located in the target directory inside the main project folder ant it could be executed like.
- <code>java -jar ./target/send-email-ses.jar</code> (in Linux/MacOs)
- <code>java -jar .\target\send-email-ses.jar</code> (in Windows)

And it will show the coomand help, like this:

<code>
PS C:\Temp\send-email-ses> java -jar .\target\send-email-ses.jar</br>
Missing required options: f, t</br>
usage: send-email</br>

## Creating and configuring [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/)
In order create and get [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/)  ready to be used you will need to do the next steps:
1. Having a valid AWS Account or acreate a new one. See: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup.
2. Set up a new [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) in your account. See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/setting-up.html or have a oreviously created one.
3. Create and Verify [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) Identity: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html.
4. In case you want to send emails to any email address you need to move [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) out of the sanbox (production mode). See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html. Otherwise, you can just test sending emails using the simulator, like this: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-an-email-from-console.html#send-email-simulator.
5. Create a new [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/index.html](IAM) user without console access: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html.
6. Create a new access key for the recently created user: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html and keep the access key and password as well as the region you created it, you will need them to send emails later.
7. Create a sending authorization policy and assign it to the recently created user. Make sure to enable <code>ses:SendRawEmail</code> permission that is needed to use this demo. Note: To assign this IAM policy you will need the recently created user ARN. See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html#id_users_create_aws-identifiers.
